# GA4 answers - <Abhijith Anil>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part A: Your project dir and Git repo

### 1: Create subdirs, and copy `CLAUDE.md` and a FastQC report

<!-- No command/output needed. -->

### 2: Initialize a Git repository, and commit your first files

<!-- No command/output needed here -- we check the repo directly. -->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part B: A TrimGalore script --- without genAI

<!-- Reminder: no genAI in this Part! -->

### 3: A TrimGalore container, its help info, and three options

*Answer*: The container link (URI) is: [oras://community.wave.seqera.io/library/trim-galore:2.3.0--a56e49e832976df4](oras://community.wave.seqera.io/library/trim-galore:2.3.0--a56e49e832976df4)

Code to run `trim_galore --help` with the container:

``` bash
# Your command: apptainer exec oras://community.wave.seqera.io/library/trim-galore:2.3.0--a56e49e832976df4 trim_galore --help
```

<!-- You don't need to paste the TrimGalore help output -->

*Answer*: The option to indicate that the reads are paired-end: --paired

*Answer*: The option to set the output dir: -o, --output_dir

*Answer*: The option to run FastQC on the trimmed FASTQ files: --fastqc

### 4: Default thresholds

*Answer*: A) The default base quality score threshold: 20

*Answer*: B) The default read length threshold: 20

### 5: Write the `trimgalore.sh` script

<!-- No need to paste the script: we'll look at scripts/trimgalore.sh directly. -->

### 6: Run the script for sample `S63`, and check the output files

Code to run the script:

``` bash
# Your command: bash scripts/trimgalore.sh \
    ../garrigos/fastq/S63_R1.fastq.gz \
    ../garrigos/fastq/S63_R2.fastq.gz \
    results/trimgalore
```

Code to list the output files:

``` bash
# Your command: ls -lh results/trimgalore/
```

The output of the command was:

```

*Answer*: What each type of output file contains: The output file contains trimmed , gzip-compressed FASTQ files for R1 and R2, JSONtrimming reports for each read, HTML and ZIP FASTQC trimmed reads. The FASTQ files contain processed sequences and trimming reports.

### 7: Trimming results

*Answer*: Which adapter sequence TrimGalore looked for, and how it decided on this: The adapter sequence it looked for is 'AGATCGGAAGAGC'. Trimgalore may have looked automatically detected the adapter and help output also says automatic detection is supported.

*Answer*: Percentage of reads with adapters in R1 and R2: 13 % and 10.1 % respectively.

*Answer*: In R1 and R2, were more bases removed by quality trimming or by adapter trimming?Quality trimming

*Answer*: Percentage of read pairs that were removed: 7.4%

### 8: Poly-G trimming

*Answer*: Did TrimGalore do poly-G trimming, and did you have to tell it to? Yes. Poly -G trimming was enabled automatically.

*Answer*: What TrimGalore concludes about the sequencing technology: It concludes that reads had 2-colour sequencer artifact.

*Answer*: Was more poly-G trimming done in R1 or R2? (Optional: any idea why?) More poly-G trimming was done in R2. Maybe R2 will be having lower sequencing quality than R1 resulting in more poly-G trimming.

### 9: Compare the FastQC reports before and after trimming

*Answer*: At least two differences between the reports, and whether things look better in terms of pass/warn/fail status: The number of reads decreased from 500,000 to 462,984 after trim galore processing. Another difference noted was that Per-base N content improved from warning to pass and over represented sequences changed from fail to pass.Per-base sequence quality and per-sequence quality score passed before and after trimming. Howevver, per-base sequence content and per-sequence GC content continued to fail and sequence length distribution remained at warning status.

*Answer*: Were the short reads with only `N`s removed? If so, was that due to the length threshold, or something else? The short reads containing Ns appear to be removed after trimming. The reason for this could be the length threshold of 20 bp. The sequences removed because of too many N bases is 0. So the reads were likely removed because of length threshold.

*Answer*: Something you didn't expect or are confused about: Why still certain status is still in fail and not improved.

## Part C: Bring in genAI

<!-- Export the conversations for questions 10, 11, 13, and 14 to `doc/ai`. -->

### 10: Sonnet reviews your script

*Answer*: Your prompt:

*Answer*: Claude's suggestions, and for each, whether you agree, disagree, or don't understand it, and why:

*Answer*: Was anything wrong, or in conflict with the course's practices? Did Claude refer to your `CLAUDE.md` conventions?

*Answer*: The estimated cost of this conversation (from `/usage`):

### 11: Opus reviews your script

*Answer*: The estimated cost of this conversation (from `/usage`):

*Answer*: Which suggestions did only one of the two models make?

*Answer*: Did either model claim something that you know is wrong?

*Answer*: Did either model check its claims, for example by running commands?

*Answer*: Did Opus's review change your mind about any of your answers to question 10?

*Answer*: How did the costs compare? Which review would you trust more, and why? Was the difference worth the difference in cost?

### 12: Run the script with a non-existent file

``` bash
# Your command:
```

*Answer*: Your prompt:

``` bash
# Your command to test the updated script:
```

The output of the command was:

```         
```

### 14: Claude writes a loop

*Answer*: Your prompt:

The loop that Claude wrote:

``` bash
# Paste Claude's loop here

*Answer*: Does it run the script once per sample?

*Answer*: Does it get the correct R2 file for each R1 file?

``` bash
# Your command(s) to check the output files:
```

The output of the command(s) was:
